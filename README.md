# üìä Analytics, Data Science, and AI  
_Projects in Machine Learning & Applied Data Science_  
**Durham University & MIT Applied Data Science Program**

This repository showcases hands-on data science projects completed during my studies at Durham University and the MIT Applied Data Science Program. Each project demonstrates key data science skills‚Äîdata cleaning, modeling, visualization, and interpretation‚Äîacross multiple domains such as finance, genetics, affective computing, and natural language processing.

## üîπ Affective AI: Facial Emotion Recognition

![Face](/assets/face.png)

**[Facial Emotion Recognition Project](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/c7b8338f8652429e9c0ba01395e977b079f8055f/Affective_AI_Project.html)**  
A deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify facial emotions (happy, sad, neutral, surprise) using a dataset of over 20,000 images.

- Achieved **80.02% accuracy**.
- Implemented dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.

## üîπ Regression Analysis on Gene Expression

![Gene](/assets/gene.png)

**[Gene Expression Regression Report](https://github.com/Amberisfree/data-science-and-analytic/blob/d1c61ebed36a1940e0723951de937b0edf4e2b6c/regression%20analysis%20on%20gene%20expression/reg_sum.pdf)**  
Explored regression methods for risk factor identification across thousands of genes.

- Used **Lasso Regularization**, **PCA**, and cross-validation to reduce dimensionality.
- Applied non-parametric smoothing (locopoly, B-spline, additive models).
- Evaluated models using R¬≤, residual diagnostics, and bootstrap CI.

## üîπ Finance: Personal Loan Classification

![Finance](/assets/finance.png)

**[Loan Classification Analysis](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/main/Bank_loan_Analysis/bank_loan.html)**  
Classification model to predict which liability customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer.

- Techniques: decision trees, bagging, boosting, random forest.
- Reduced **false negative rate from 0.13 to 0.08** using MLR3 threshold tuning.
- Identified variable correlations for client segmentation.

## üîπ Unsupervised Learning: Generative Models

![Generative](/assets/generative.png)

**[Generative Modeling & Clustering](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Amberisfree/datascience.github.io/blob/main/UL%20ASML/UL-Summative.html)**  
Used Kernel Density Estimation and Gaussian Mixture Models to identify latent clusters in the data.

- Synthesized new data points from fitted distributions.
- Clustering via Expectation-Maximization (EM).
- Focused on High Density Regions.

**[Hamlet Character Network](https://nbviewer.org/github/Amberisfree/data-science-and-analytic/blob/main/Hamlet%20Network%20Analysis/Hamlet%20character%2002.ipynb)**  
Analyzed character relationships in *Hamlet* through dynamic network graphs.

- Built a graph from lines spoken per act.
- Applied community detection to trace plot evolution and key figures.
