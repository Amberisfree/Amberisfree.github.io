    {{ Hey, my name is Amber Chang. I am studying in MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis at Durham University and am actively pursuing a career in the field of Data Analysis or Software Engineering.

A passion for problem solving and analytical thinking led me to combine High Performace Computing and Data Science.

This gave me a thorough knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning as well as some deep learning, I have listed several projects related to machine learning and data science in Data Sceince section.

As a computer science major, I found my interest in both Uncertainty Quantification and Parallel Computing. Under the supervision of Anne Reinarz, I have been devoted myself in improving an existing software development-- OpenGo Simulation


Having completed my masters, I am looking to secure a job in Data in which I look forward to applying cutting edge machine learning models to real world problems.
