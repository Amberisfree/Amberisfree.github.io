![About Me](/assets/IMG_1508.jpeg)

Hey, my name is Amber Chang.

Highly motivated researcher working at the intersection of computer vision, graphics, and machine learning,
with a focus on integrating painting and computational creativity into ML systems. Passionate about interactive
ML-driven art, multi-modal reasoning, and design intelligence.

I am studying in MSc in Scientific Computing and Data Analysis at Durham University and am actively pursuing a career in the field of Computational Data Science and AI.

A passion for problem solving and analytical thinking led me to combine High Performace Computing and Data Science.

This gave me a thorough knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning as well as some deep learning, I have listed several projects related to machine learning in Data Sceince section.

As a computer science major, I found my interest in both [Uncertainty Quantification and Parallel Computing.](https://github.com/Amberisfree/UQ/tree/master)  Under the supervision of [Anne Reinarz](https://annereinarz.github.io), I have been devoted myself in improving the prediction of an existing software development-- [OpenGo Simulation](https://opengosim.com)


Having completed my masters, I am looking to secure a job in Data in which I look forward to applying cutting edge machine learning models to real world problems.
