# 👋 Hi, I'm Amber Chang

I’m a researcher and creative technologist exploring the space where **computer vision**, **graphics**, and **machine learning** meet. My work focuses on building **generative and interactive ML systems** that blend computational creativity with human-centered design.

I’m especially passionate about:
- Multi-modal intelligence  
- ML-driven art & creative tools  
- Reasoning + generation pipelines  
- High-performance simulation and inference  

After completing my master’s in scientific computing, I’m now looking for opportunities in **data science**, **machine learning**, or **AI research**, where I can apply cutting-edge models to meaningful real-world problems.
